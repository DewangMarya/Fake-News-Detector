# Fake news detection #

### Programming Language ###

We will be sticking with Python as the programming language for out project.

Although we have worked on the code for a while now, we haven't pushed anything to the repo because we kept sharing the code through other means.

### Initial Approach ###

This topic is very broad, so we're trying a different approach. We're trying it out with different models, and that's why the first file is called the draft1.py, as it is going to need a lot of changes.
